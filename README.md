# swasthyam

Today everything has gone online from offices to crucial meetings, from schools to colleges, almost everything. 
And this has directly impacted people's well-being state. People are getting stressed out and feeling depressed day by day. 
And as a positive response to this situation. We have designed a platform that is focused to present a stress-free environment.

Our project "Swasthyam" provides multiple routes to get stress-free and feel a little relieved in this busy world. 
We have included online games, meditating exercises, standup comedy videos, and much more by keeping in mind the needs 
and interests of a person.
