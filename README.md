### Project Description:- ###
Today everything has gone online from offices to crucial meetings, schools to colleges, almost everything. And this has directly impacted people's well-being state. People are getting stressed out and feeling depressed day by day. And as a positive response to this situation, we have designed a platform that is focused to present a stress-free environment.

Our project "Swasthyam" provides multiple routes to have a stress-free mind and feel a little relieved in this busy world. We have included mantras, online games, meditating exercises, standup comedy videos, and much more by keeping the needs and interests of a stressed person.
